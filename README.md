Simple app from udacity final project developping android apps

Hey folks from around the world,\
this is a simple android app to display movie list from cloud
the full spesification for the app can be looked in here
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlN1fUsCSKuInLECcJkslIqvpKlP7jWL2TP9m6UiA6I/pub?embedded=true

this app works as a final project for the udacity course for developping android apps
(links to the course https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud853/lessons/1395568821/concepts/16438585680923#)

this app is purely for educational purposes only and can be used as an example app to learn the basics of androids and get to know 
with some of the libraries it used

now I'm aware that this app probably didn't meet some of the requirements that is written from the specification
consider it as the flaw of this app

there are many bugs and maybe things that can be done better so I do hope you can get in touch with me for things future improvements

feel free to fork this app into your repositories, or contributing for making this app more awesome
